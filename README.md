# Education and Career Journey Website by Jialin

This project is a personal website that chronicles my educational and professional journey. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio, detailing my academic background, projects, research, and personal insights into the world of technology. The website is designed to showcase my proficiency in modern web development technologies and project management.

## Website Structure

- **Introduction**: A brief welcome and overview of the site's purpose.
- **Educational Journey**: An interactive timeline highlighting my educational milestones.
- **Projects & Intern**: A detailed view of my projects and research work, with functionality to filter entries by technology used.
- **About Me**: A view of my basic personal information and hobbies.
- **Contact**: A page with a contact form allowing visitors to reach out to me directly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** and **CSS3**: For structuring and styling the website.
- **TypeScript**: For interactive elements and ensuring type safety.
- **React**: Used to build dynamic components such as the blog and project filters.
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment workflows.

## Features

- **Interactive Timeline**: Utilizes TypeScript and CSS animations to display educational and professional milestones.
- **Dynamic Project Filters**: Allows users to filter projects and research by the technologies used, implemented with React state management.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the website is accessible and functional across all devices.

## Deployment

This site is deployed on Azure Static Apps, benefiting from integrated CI/CD through GitHub Actions, which automates the deployment process upon each push to the repository.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you need to run
### `npm install` 

to install the necessary modules at first, then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
